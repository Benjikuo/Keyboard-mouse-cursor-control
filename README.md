## 🛠️ Why I built this
- Operate the cursor when a mouse is missing, broken, or unavailable.
- Work effectively in tight spaces where mouse movement is constrained.
- Provide a alternative when touchpads are inaccurate or unresponsive.

## ▶️ How to Run
**.ahk:** You need to install AutoHotkey to run this script.
